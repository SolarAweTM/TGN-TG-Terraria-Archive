# TGN/TG/TGF Terraria World Archive
This is an archive of all the world downloads I have found during my time on and moderating the Terraria Server.
If there is something missing, DM me on Discord (Solar Awe#1543) with the world.
Special thanks to Aiken for creating the original archives.

In the `After` folder, you can find worlds for Seasons after they've finished.
In the `Before` folder, you can find worlds for Seasons before they released.
The Older Seasons folder contains worlds that are from Season 7 and before.
If a world is missing from the `Before` folder, chances are you'll be able to recreate the original world by just taking the seed from the same world in the `After` folder.

## Regarding modded worlds
For modded worlds, make sure you download BOTH the .wld AND the .twld file.

## About players
Player data is stored in the `Players` folder within the archives, sorted by season.
Please note that due to limitations on the conversion methods I use, all players will use the default male style, and any mounts/pets/hooks were not converted.
