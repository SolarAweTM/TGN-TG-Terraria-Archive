## TGN/TG/TGF Terraria World Archive
This is an archive of all the world downloads I have found during my time on and moderating the Terraria Server.
If there is something missing, DM me on Discord (Solar Awe#1543) with the world.
Special thanks to Aiken for creating the original archives.

In the After folder, you can find worlds for Seasons after they've finished.
In the Before folder, you can find worlds for Seasons before they released.
The Older Seasons folder contains worlds that are from Season 7 and before.


# About the player file
The player file in the root directory is my attempt at translating TShock SSC data into an actual player file. It only contains the data leading up to the safe, and I did this by hand.
